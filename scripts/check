### Default commands

# Check code for quality and correctness.
#
# Running `check` without a sub-command is the same as running `check commit`.
def main []: nothing -> string {
    main commit
}

# Run all checks and tests.
#
# Currently this is the same as running `check push`
def "main all" []: nothing -> string {
    main push
}

### Grouped tasks

# Run all checks that should pass before committing.
#
# This performs the following checks in order and stops on the first failure:
#
#   - Pre-Commit checks
def "main commit" []: nothing -> string {
    main pre
}

# Run all checks that should pass before pushing.
#
# This performs the following checks in order and stops on the first failure:
#
#   - All the checks from `check commit`
#   - Pre-Push checks
#   - All the checks from `check sec`
#   - Licence checking
def "main push" []: nothing -> string {
    main pre all
    main docs
    main sec
    main licences
}

# Run all security checks.
#
# This performs the following checks in order and stops on the first failure:
#
#   - Vulnerabilities
#   - Secrets
def "main sec" []: nothing -> string {
    main sec vuln
    main sec secret
}


### Individual checking tasks

# Run almost all pre-commit hooks on all files.
#
# The `check_commit` hook is not run.  Run `check commit` separately for that.
def --wrapped "main pre" [
    ...rest: string # Extra arguments for pre-commit
]: nothing -> any {
    pre-commit validate-config
    pre-commit validate-manifest
    let $temp_config = (filter_pre_commit_config "check_commit" "check_push")
    echo $temp_config
    pre-commit run -c $temp_config --all-files ...$rest
    rm $temp_config
}

# Run almost all pre-push hooks on all files.
#
# The `check_push` hook is not run.  Run `check push` separately for that.
def --wrapped "main pre push" [
    ...rest: string # Extra arguments for pre-commit
]: nothing -> string {
    main pre --hook-stage pre-push ...$rest
}

# Run almost all pre-commit and pre-push hooks on all files.
#
# The `check_commit` and `check_push` hooks are not run.  Run `check push` separately
# for that.
def --wrapped "main pre all" [
    ...rest: string # Extra arguments for pre-commit
]: nothing -> string {
    print Pre-commit...
    main pre ...$rest
    print Pre-push...
    main pre push
}

# Run licensing checks on all files
def --wrapped "main licences" [
    ...rest: string # Extra arguments for pre-commit
]: nothing -> string {
    reuse lint
}

# Run documentation building check
def "main docs" []: nothing -> string {
    # docs build return non-zero exit code if there is any problem.
    docs build
}

### Individual security tasks

# Check dependencies for security vulnerabilities.
def "main sec vuln" []: nothing -> string {
    let project_root = (git rev-parse --show-toplevel | str trim)
    let report_path = ($project_root | path join ".local" "cache" "trivy" "report.json")
    # Report vulnerabilities
    trivy fs . --scanners vuln -f json -o $report_path
    trivy convert --scanners vuln $report_path
    # Fail if any are HIGH or CRITICAL
    (
        # --format template without a template silences output.
        trivy fs . --scanners vuln --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --exit-code 1 --quiet
        --format template
    )
}

# Check for secrets that should not be shared.
def "main sec secret" []: nothing -> string {
    trivy fs . --scanners secret --exit-code 1
}

## Internal commands

# Create a temporary copy of .pre-commit-config.yaml but with certain hooks removed.
#
# This is desired because pre-commit neither supports excluding certain hooks nor
# including other config files.
def filter_pre_commit_config [...filter_hooks: string] {
    let orig_config = (open .pre-commit-config.yaml)
    let orig_repos = $orig_config | get repos
    let filtered_repos = $orig_repos | where {|item|
        not ($item.hooks.0.id in $filter_hooks)
    }
    let new_config = $orig_config | update repos $filtered_repos
    let temp_file = (mktemp -t --suffix .yaml)
    $new_config | to yaml | save -a $temp_file
    $temp_file
}
