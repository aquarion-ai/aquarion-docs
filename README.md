# Aquarion AI - Documentation

Experiment in creating a scalable local AI voice chat bot.

<!-- --8<-- [start:description] -->

## Description

### About Aquarion AI

The overall goal of the Aquarion AI project is to create an LLM-based voice chat bot /
assistant, but to build it in such a way that is can be scaled down to a single desktop
app, and all the way up to a distributed multi-server, horizontally scalable system.
Also, desired is a taking head / avatar whose mouth moves with the speech.  Lastly, it
should all run locally / offline, even in an air-gapped environment.  Oh, and it should
be modular enough to support multiple alternate STT, LLM and TTS models/engines/options.
